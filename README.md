hello-world
I enjoy working in an environment where excellence is really expected. I believe what makes or creates that environment and truly makes it great is to be open when [the work] is not great. My best contribution is not settling for anything but good stuff, in all the details. That is my job â€” to make sure everything is great. I am a Microsoft Cloud Architect specialize in Cloud Identity, Hybrid Cloud or Mobility and Security for Enterprise Infrastructure and cloud management. I am passionate about technology and have an insatiable drive for learning.
